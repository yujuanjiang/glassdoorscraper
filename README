Started this project as I'm preparing for a job interview.

Version 1.0 (probably will be the only version lol) functionalities:

 Scrape 
 	- date
	- location
	- title
	- interview questions
 from a company's landing page

It's designed only for a quick hand to get the interview questions, but please feel free to add more functionalities into it. :)

***NO COMMERCIAL USE***
