310," Sep. 14, 2019","Ottawa, ON",Software Developer," In the design/problem solving session, I paired with the interviewer to design a web service. Given an initial set of requirements, we made a high-level design of the service (while asking questions back and forth). As we worked through solving the problem, additional requirements were thrown in to add to the complexity, where we would build on the design to accommodate them.   Answer Question In the pair-programming sessions, I was allowed to use the programming language of my choice and was allowed to look at resources online. The problems did not involve regurgitating algorithms or otherwise require knowing something beforehand. Rather, they were simpler problems that were either more related to the role (any domain knowledge required was explained during the interview in my case) or perhaps more fun problems that one wouldn't normally solve day-to-day professionally. Additional requirements and complexities were also thrown onto the problems as I made my way through them. One of the problems I had was: given a string, return an array of strings based on certain rules. During the pair-programming sessions, I was also asked to talk about my thought process to the interviewer.   Answer Question"
